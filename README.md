Increasing Efficiency of given Rankine cycle.

## Rankine Cycle
The Rankine cycle is a theoretical thermodynamic model depicting the operation of steam power plants. Comprising four stages—compression, heat addition, expansion, and heat rejection—it illustrates the transformation of water into steam to generate power. The cycle begins with water compression, followed by isobaric heating in a boiler, expansion through a turbine, and concludes with isobaric heat rejection in a condenser. While idealized, the Rankine cycle provides fundamental insights into the efficiency of steam-based power systems, guiding the analysis and optimization of practical applications.

## Methods used to increase the efficiency of Rankine Cycle
1. Reheating
2. Regeneration
